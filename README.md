### Exploratory Data Analysis on Iris data set

This is an R Markdown Notebook with Exploratory Data Analysis on the iris dataset. The goal of this analysis to to understand the dataset by erxploring values under each of the categories of flowers. This Exploratory Data Analysis helps in understanding and preparing the dataset for applying Machine Learning algorithms later on.

### Dataset Description

Iris dataset was introduced by Ronald Fisher, a British Biologist in 1936. The data set has 150 observations, around 50 for each species of Iris - setosa, virginica and versicolor. There are 4 features measured on each sample - length and the width of sepal and petal, in centimeters. Fisher built a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species using the 4 features.
